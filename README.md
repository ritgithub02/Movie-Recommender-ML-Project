## Movie Recommender ML Project

---

### Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on building a movie recommender system. The project aims to leverage various machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions.

### Dataset:

The dataset used for this project includes information about movies, such as titles, genres, keywords, cast, and directors.

### Content:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Load the dataset using pandas and select relevant columns.
   - Fill missing values with empty strings.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Combine selected features (title, genres, keywords, cast, director) into a single feature called "features".

3. **Text Vectorization:**
   - Use CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Compute cosine similarity between movies based on their feature vectors.
   - Implement a function to get recommendations for a given movie title.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Generate bar plots to visualize the similarity scores of recommended movies.


### Requirements:

- Python 3.11
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
